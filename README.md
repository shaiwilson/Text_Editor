##A Markov Text Editor.

A smart text editor/processor that incorporates autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct. 

I developed the back-end code, in that I worked with the text, and not directly with any user interface components. This is so that I could really dig in and experiment with the different data structures that I'm learning and the running times for each of them.
